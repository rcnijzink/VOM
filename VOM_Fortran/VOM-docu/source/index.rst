Welcome to VOM's documentation!
===============================
The vegetation optimality model was developed to model the water use by
natural vegetation for use in hydrological models. The aim of the model is
to predict vegetation water use based on meterological information, soils
and topography only, without the need for prescribing site-specific
vegetation properties or calibration against observed fluxes.
