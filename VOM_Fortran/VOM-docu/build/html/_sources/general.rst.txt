Model Information
-----------------
Name:
Coupled Water Balance and Vegetation Optimality Model
Author Contact:
Stan Schymanski, ETH Zurich
Date of first version:
April 2006
Date of last update:
September 2013

Model Purpose:
-----------------
The vegetation optimality model was developed to model the water use by
natural vegetation for use in hydrological models. The aim of the model is
to predict vegetation water use based on meterological information, soils
and topography only, without the need for prescribing site-specific
vegetation properties or calibration against observed fluxes. 
      
The original theory and equations used in the model are described in:
      
      S. J. Schymanski. Transpiration as the Leak in the Carbon Factory: A Model
      of Self-Optimising Vegetation. PhD thesis, University of Western
      Australia, Perth, Australia, 2007.

    However, the present version uses a simplified catchment geometry
      (rectangular slab of soil), as described in Watbal3.pdf.
