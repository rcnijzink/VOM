The documentation of VOM consists of two pdf files containing equations,
and two directories containing html documentation. 

The directory html_docu contains hand-written html documentation. This is helpful for compiling and
running the model.

The directory Fordocu contains automatically generated documenation
based on commens in the .f90 files. This one is helpful for understanding the
structure of the source code.
